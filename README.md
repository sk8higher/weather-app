# weather-app

## This is a simple Weather app, written in vanilla JS.

## In this project I have used:

- Asynchronous JavaScript;
- Fetching from APIs (OpenWeatherAPI, browser's GeolocationAPI)
- Parsing JSON data;
- Error handling, working with Promises/Async/Await;
- Modules with components;
- Bundling with Webpack;
- ESLint
